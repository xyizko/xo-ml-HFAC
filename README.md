[`xo-ml-HFAgentsCourse-HFModelTest`](https://github.com/xyizko/xo-ml-HFAgentsCourse-HFModelTest) | Before gettin deep into the course this repo is for testing out the usage of teh HuggingFace API, which allows access to models that have the HF API enabled, note there are some models that dont even require an api and can be accessed directly with the hugging face client.
